# milk-alert-project

Hello everybody!!
Happy to share my first personal project with you!
The "Milk_Project" is a solution for those annoying times when you want coffee so much but your milk bottle turns out to be practically empty!
With the 3D printing technology and electronic components (Arduino) I was able to create a product for my own desire.

As you can see in the video, It is a very easy and convenient product.
It fits the fridge door, portable (battery) and connected to an app.

At first use, the product connects to the application (Blynk), calibrates the weight to zero Kg and sends messages to the User.
When the product recognizes very low weight, it counts 20 seconds and then alerts that the milk is almost empty!

Easy, convenient and smart.
Thanks for watching!!
